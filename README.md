If you are setting up the tls-scanner, you will be targeting the `local` environment.

Clone or fork this repository.

If you are developing this project:

`cd` to the repository root directory and run:  
```shell
npm install
```

# Configuration

Copy the config/config.example.json to config/config.local.json.  
Use the config/config.js for documentation and further examples.

Once you have worked through the above steps, head back to the [local setup](https://purpleteam-labs.com/doc/local/set-up/) documentation to continue setting up the other _PurpleTeam_ components.
